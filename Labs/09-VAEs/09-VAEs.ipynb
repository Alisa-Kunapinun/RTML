    "# Lab 09: Variational Autoencoders\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will learn how to build and train a variational autoencoder following [Kingma and Welling (2014)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "The application the authors consider is a generative model for the MNIST digits dataset that uses a spherical Gaussian for the latent space.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll first look at the official VAE PyTorch example code (https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/vae).\n",
    "They follow Kingma and Welling in that the encoder $q_\\phi(\\mathbf{x})$ and the decoder $p_\\theta(\\mathbf{z})$ are both fully-connected neural networks.\n",
    "However, in the original paper, the authors use sigmoid hidden units and the AdaGrad optimizer. In the PyTorch VAE example, the implementers find that it\n",
    "converges much faster with ReLU hidden units and the Adam optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we'll explore the use of convolutional layers rather than fully-connected layers for the encoder and decoder, for MNIST, AIT ICT Faces, and CelebA.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deep generative models overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep generative models have 2 major families:\n",
    " - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\n",
    " - Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both models can produce highly realistic content such as images, text documents, and sounds. The difference\n",
    "is that GANs use two networks (generator and discriminator) that play a minimax game to optimize performance, whereas\n",
    "the VAE is an autoencoder in which the distribution at the bottlneck layer is regularised during training in order to\n",
    "ensure that the latent space has good properties (smoothness), enabling the decoder to act as a regularized generator\n",
    "that can generate novel data consistent with the training data set. The term \"variational\" comes from the close relationship\n",
    "between regularisation and the variational inference method in statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the idea of the GAN's structure from [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-variational-autoencoders-vaes-f70510919f73):\n",

    "Now, let's discuss how the VAE overcomes some issues with the ordinariy autoencoder.\n",
    "A VAE is trained with regularization to avoid overfitting and ensure that the latent space\n",
    "has good properties such as smoothness that encourage generation of novel samples consistent\n",
    "with the input distriution. Instead of encoding an input as a single point in the latent space\n",
    "each input is mapped to a *distribution* over the latent space. The model is then trained as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The input is encoded, resulting in a distribution over the latent space\n",
    "2. A point from the latent space is sampled from that distribution\n",
    "3. The sampled point is decoded and the reconstruction error is computed\n",
    "4. The reconstruction error is backpropagated through the network\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/diffAE_VAEs.png\" title=\"Difference between autoencoder and VAEs\" style=\"width: 1080;\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "We would ordinarily (but not necessarily) choose the encoded distribution to be multivariate Gaussian, meaning the encoder should produce a mean vector and covariance\n",
    "matrix for each input. Putting together the output loss function (reconstruction error) with the regularization at the latent layer will give us an encoder and decoder\n",
    "that are both performant in terms of reconstruction error and well organized at the latent layer. Since we have to reconstruct the input accurately from any of the\n",
    "samples it might generate at the latent layer, we should obtain smooth behavior in which interpolation of latent vectors yield realistic and smoothly varying samples\n",
    "at the output. Obtaining this result means \"simply\" penalizing the Kulback-Leibler divergence between the latent distribution and a standardized Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/VAEs.png\" title=\"VAEs loss function\" style=\"width: 640;\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we cannot push the encoded distribution for every input to the standard normal distribution exactly, as we would not then be able to reconstruct the input!\n",
